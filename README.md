# cardScanner
A page crawler to download and categorize card images.

You should be able to run the app with these commands:

    $ npm install
    $ node fetch-card-images.js

A full run would take many, many hours. If this is your first time to run it, then that's probably not what you want to do. Instead, let it run for a few minutes, long enough to download a few directories worth of image files. Then you can browse the structure of the card-images directory tree. This directory is .git-ignored, btw.
